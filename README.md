# H5Analysis

This is a library to analyse, plot, and export HDF5 data. The package is meant to provide a framework to load data in jupyter notebooks and enable data interaction.

## Installation

Install the package from PyPi with the pip package manager. This is the recommended way to obtain a copy for your local machine and will install all required dependencies.

```
$ pip install h5analysis
```

You will also need [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter) together with python 3 on your local machine.

In case that certain widgets aren't rendered properly, make sure to enable the appropriate jupyter extensions

```
$ jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
```
